        <p class="lead"><b> Why do some states like Hawaii have dramatically <br>
        higher percentages? </b></p>
        
        <p> Though they make one United States of America, each state has its own <br>
        unique history. Hawaii is an exceptionally unique case. In undergrad, I <br>
        learned that due to its proximity to Asia, Hawaii hosted many immigrants from Asia <br>
        who intermarried with each other and native Hawaiians. In fact, in the 1960s, <br>
        anthropologists studied the people of Hawaii idealizing the strength and attractive-<br>
        ness of mixed race folks on the islands, which might be considered today to be <br>
        idealized, reductionist classifications. The Hawaiian term "hapa" means "mixed race" <br>
        has been adopted into English American vernacular today. <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead"><b> What exactly is mixed race? </b></p>
        
        <p> Fasciatingly, most racial categories in the US census have not been contsant<br>
        throughout the country's history. For example, in the cirst census in 1870, the closest<br>
        categorization to what today is understood as "mixed race" was "mulatto", which meant<br>
        black and some other race. Other cateogires in that original census were: White, Black,<br>
        Indian, and Chinese. Meanwhile, come 1920, census race categories were the original <br>
        original categories plus Japanese, Filipino, Korean, and Hindu. Today, the race categories <br>
        offered are even more different. For more information, you can go this interesting page<br>
        by the Pew Research Center: <br> <br>
        <a href = "http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/interactives/multiracial-timeline/">http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/interactives/multiracial-timeline/</a><br>
        <br>
        It is interesting to consider the <b> data model </b> used by US census creators <br>
        and the political and social goals (use goals?) behind them. Is it a structured <br>
        dataset since the census comes up with the model? Or is it a semistructured set since <br>
        people fill out which racial category to which they belong on their census forms? <br>
        <br>
        It is also worthwhile considering the human agency and inconsistency in census racial<br>
        categorization. For instance, a person in 1870 may have been Chinese in the eyes of <br>
        the US government, but come 1920, that same person may have been Filipino.
